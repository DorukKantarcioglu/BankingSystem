# BankingSystem
 
 A simple project simulating the operations of a bank, such as account registeration and termination, money depositing/withdrawing and fund transfers. Implemented in order to enhance my understanding of data structures. Main data structures utilized are linked lists and queues, which are implemented via pointers.
