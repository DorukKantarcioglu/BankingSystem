# BankingSystem
 
 A simple project simulating the operations of a bank, such as account registeration, money depositing/withdrawing, money transfers and account terminations. Implemented in order to enhance my understanding of data structures. Main data structures utilized are linked lists and queues. These structures are implemented via pointers.
